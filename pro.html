            16-Bit Mac Unit</h2>
            <img src="./Projects/multiplier.png" alt="Mac photo">
            <p>In this proposed multiplier, we have used Vedic Multiplication method to design an area-efficient multiplier , as Vedic multiplication is more efficient when compared to other multipliers. We have designed this multiplier using compressors to reduce the partial products in multiplication.<br>
                This model consists of various compressors which produces the output in single stages without any partial steps.In normal multiplier methods there are many partial steps which increases the computational speed of a multiplier. 
                So using Vedic Multiplication with compressors which reduce the area of the multiplier unit.In this design, the output of the respective bits depend only on the previous carry bits and input bits of that particular stage and do not depend on the carry bits of other stages.<br> Here the carry bits generated in the particular stage will get added up all together to the next respective input bits. So in this way carry propagation takes place in the proposed multiplier which is quite different from the existing models. In the existing models if the carry bits generated at the stage is more than the one then the carry bits are propagated to each and every upcoming stages in a linear fashion which makes the upcoming stages not only depend on the previous carry bits but also on the other carry bits.

                Garbage collector</h2>
                <img src="./Projects/garbageCollector.jpg" alt="Garbage collector">
                <p>Water sources are contaminated by garbage,
                    weeds and plastic wastes. Effective waste removal in water
                    sources such as lakes, ponds and rivers is essential for waste
                    management and control. In India, aquatic waste
                    management and control is of main concern for implementing
                    smart cities and achieving the mission of a cleaner India.
                    Therefore, this work aims at creating an automated system to
                    tackle the problem of water waste removal. Lake cleaning
                    robot system for removing the surface wastes is experimented
                    in this work. In this project we are going to use Solidworks and
                    Proteus software to model and build Arduino Circuit for our
                    water collector bot. It will collect the waste from the surface of
                    water and dump it into the tub placed behind it. With the use
                    of motors the bot and collectors will have to & fro movement.
                    We will simulate the working of our bot virtually in Unity
                    Software. Reviewing the results shows that the project can be
                    used for effective waste removal from the surface of the water

            <li> Automatic Car Parking System</h2>
                <img src="./Projects/car1.jpg">
                <p>This smart parking system project consists of Arduino, six IR sensors, one servo motor, and one LCD display. Where the Arduino is the main microcontroller that controls the whole system. Two IR sensors are used at the entry and exit gates to detect vehicle entry and exit in the parking area. And other four IR sensors are used to detect the parking slot availability. The servo motor is placed at the entry and exit gate that is used to open and close the gates. Also, an LCD display is placed at the entrance, which is used to show the availability of parking slots in the parking area.</p>
                <p>When a vehicle arrives at the gate of the parking area, the display continuously shows the number of empty slots. If there have any empty slots then the system opens the entry gate by the servo motor. After entering the car into the parking area, when it will occupy a slot, then the display shows this slot is full.

                    If there is no empty parking slot then the system displays all slots are full and does not open the gate.</p>
